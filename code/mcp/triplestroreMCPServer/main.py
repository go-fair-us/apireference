def text_search(text: str):
    """Search for datasets containing a specific text term within their descriptions.

       This tool performs a full-text search across dataset descriptions in the RDF triplestore
       to find datasets that contain a specified search term. It uses QLever's built-in text
       search capabilities to locate datasets where the search term appears in text entities
       that are linked to dataset descriptions.

       Parameters:
           text (str): The search term or phrase to look for within dataset descriptions.
                       The search is case-sensitive and looks for exact word matches.
                       For example: "climate", "ocean temperature", "biodiversity"

       Returns:
           list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a dataset match.
                 Each result contains:
                 - uri: The URI identifier of the dataset
                 - count: Number of text occurrences containing the search term
                 - example_text: A sample text snippet showing the search term in context
                 - item: The description text that matched the search criteria

                 Results are ordered by count (descending) and limited to 50 matches.

       Usage:
           Use this tool to discover datasets related to specific topics or research areas.
           The search helps identify relevant datasets by examining their descriptive metadata
           rather than requiring exact knowledge of dataset identifiers or classifications.

       Examples:
           - Find climate-related datasets: text_search("climate")
           - Locate oceanographic data: text_search("ocean")
           - Search for biodiversity research: text_search("species")

       Note:
           The search excludes datasets from "gleaner.io" domains and filters out blank nodes
           to focus on well-defined, accessible datasets. The function uses QLever-specific
           SPARQL extensions for efficient text search operations.

                     The query should use "COUNT" and alias the result as "?count".

    object that can be sent to language models or other conversational services.

    Parameters:
        topic (str): The specific subject, concept, term, or idea that the client
                     wants explained. This should be a concise descriptor that clearly
                     identifies what needs to be explained (e.g., "quantum computing",

    Usage in MCP Context:
        Clients can invoke this prompt function through the MCP interface, passing
        only the topic parameter. The MCP server handles the generation of the
        full message, ensuring consistent formatting across all explanation requests.

        - Reduces client-side code complexity
        - Ensures consistent prompt engineering practices
        - Allows server-side updates to prompt patterns without client changes
        - Supports prompt versioning and optimization

    Example Client Usage:
        request_explanation("neural networks")
        # The MCP server generates: "Can you please explain the concept of 'neural networks'?"

    Note:
        This prompt uses a simple template, but can be extended to include additional

       prompts, this function explicitly returns a UserMessage object with formatted content,
       giving clients more control over message construction while maintaining consistent
       code generation requests.

       Parameters:
           language (str): The programming language for the requested code. Should be a
                           valid language name (e.g., "Python", "JavaScript", "SQL", "SPARQL").
                           The language name is inserted directly into the prompt to ensure
                           the generated code matches client requirements.

           task_description (str): A detailed description of what the code should accomplish.
                                  This should clearly explain the functionality, inputs,
                                  outputs, and any specific requirements or constraints.
                                  More detailed descriptions typically yield better results.

       Returns:
           UserMessage: A fully constructed UserMessage object with content field containing
                       the formatted code generation request. The MCP framework handles this
                       object type directly, preserving any metadata or special formatting.

       Usage in MCP Architecture:
           - Clients invoke this prompt through the MCP interface by providing the language
             and task description parameters
           - The MCP server constructs the appropriate UserMessage with optimized formatting
           - The message is sent to the connected AI service (LLM)
           - The response (typically containing generated code) is returned to the client

       Benefits for MCP Clients:
           - Standardized code request format ensures consistent AI responses
           - Reduces prompt engineering burden on client implementations
           - Allows for server-side prompt improvements without client changes
           - Provides explicit typing via UserMessage objects rather than raw strings

       Example Client Usage:
           request_code("Python", "Sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key")

       Integration Notes:
           This prompt works best with AI services that understand code generation requests
           and can produce properly formatted, functional code snippets in the requested
           language. The prompt is designed to be clear and direct to maximize the quality
           of generated code.
